#Development tools for the ZX Spectrum

The Dockerfile is the basis of the devcontainer.

The devcontainer contains various assemblers etc.

Build the example project by running `make` from the terminal or the VSCode extension.

Debug in the built in simulator or in CSpect externally (example CSpect invocation on Windows would be `CSpect.exe -w2 -debug -remote`).
